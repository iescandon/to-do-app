# to-do-app

Our app will render all of our to-do list and will allow for us to add and remove from that list as well. We will also be adding these to-dos to local storage so our data persists on page reload. Lastly if we have time we will try playing with this API and see if we can render todos from there instead https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.

What we will be reviewing as we create our To Do app in this office hours:
- Using variables
- Using loops and conditional (if/else) statements
- Declaring and using functions
- Traversing the DOM/Modifying HTML via JS/Creating HTML via JS
- Click and submit events
- Local storage
- Using data-attributes
